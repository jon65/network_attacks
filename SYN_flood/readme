Form of DDOS

In this task, we will explore SYN flood and RST (reset) attacks.SYN Flood AttacksSYN
flood is a form of DoS attack in which attackers send many SYN requests to a victim’s TCP
port, but the attackers have no intention to finish the 3-way handshake procedure. Attackers
either use spoofed IP address or do not continue the procedure. Through this attack, attackers
can flood the victim’s queue that is used for half-opened connections, i.e. the connections that
has finished SYN, SYN-ACK, but has not yet got a final ACK back. When this queue is full,
the victim cannot take any more connection.
